# From Client-Managed to SaaS: **Value Added Products**

## Introduction
This guide is designed to help OEM partners with a Qlik Sense Client-managed deployments that are thinking or willing to move to SaaS.

There are a number of "Add On" capabilities with Client Managed products such as alerting reporting and chat bots that we refer to as Value Added Products in the Client  Managed product set. These tools and capabilities haven't been converted directly "as is" to Qlik Cloud and this will not be a Gap Analysis between Client Managed and SaaS but rather a guide to describe these tools in Client managed then describe aspects of QLik Cloud which are available currently to achieve similar capabilities. Qlik is building new features in Qlik Cloud continuously, to provide similar and in many cases additional capabilities in these areas.

## Value Added Products and similar Qlik Cloud SaaS Capabilities

The key differences between Web Ticketing and JWT authentication type are subtle but important to mention:

Client Managed tools that are relivant here include :

Qlik NPrinting :

- Qlik NPrinting is a reporting platform that lets you create reports using your QlikView and Qlik Sense data, and then distribute them automatically in a range of standard formats.

Qlik Alerting :

- Qlik Alerting provides enterprise alerting for your Qlik Sense deployment. It offers self-service capabilities for users to create their own alerts on the data they have access to in Qlik Sense. It also provides the capability for users, often power users, to create and manage alerts for others with managed shared and broadcast alerts.

Qlik Insight Bot :

- Qlik Insight Bot offers a fast and easy way to ask questions and discover insights using natural language. It’s available right in Qlik Sense and through popular tools such as Slack, Skype, and Microsoft Teams. With each question, it instantly surfaces relevant charts and insights, including key drivers, comparisons, predictions and more. And its self-learning AI makes the system progressively smarter.

Information note - These are on-premise tools for Qlik Sense Enterprise on Windows and/or QlikView on Windows.


These Client managed capabilities are delivered via stand-alone "value add" products that requires full-stack implementation. 

However in Qlik Cloud, these capabilities are integrated experiences that are supporting a multitude of customer use cases - Qliks aim is not to directly replicate all Client Managed functionality in the same way necesarily.

Qlik Cloud SaaS Capabilities that are relivant here include :

Reporting from Qlik Cloud :

- Qlik reporting tools let you summarize and share insights with other users using exported documents.

Automated reporting using the Qlik Reporting Service :

- You can create automated multi-page PDF reports based on a Qlik Sense app using the Qlik Reporting Service and Qlik Application Automation. Recipients can receive complex, scheduled reports, even if they do not have access to Qlik Sense. Get started with a report template, or create a fully custom automation.

Creating a Qlik Reporting Service report :

- The Qlik Reporting Service connector blocks let you quickly and easily build customized, multi-page reports based on app sheets. This topic shows you how to use each of the reporting blocks to build reports. By the end of this topic, you'll be able to generate single-page reports based on an app sheet, generate multi-page reports, and generate customized reports with different selections applied to different sheets.

You should be familiar with Qlik Application Automation to create a Qlik Reporting Service report.

Monitoring data with alerts :

- Detect outliers and anomalies in your data quickly with alerts, without the need to open the app. You define conditions based on measures or dimensions of the data that you want to monitor. When the conditions are met, a notification with a preview of the data is sent to you.

Scheduling reports with subscriptions :

- Subscription reports let you schedule recurring emails containing a PDF of your preferred sheets or chart. You can set your desired filters and have a PDF report with the newest data delivered to your inbox at a scheduled time. For example, you could receive overnight order information in an email every morning. You can edit subscriptions you own at any time.
