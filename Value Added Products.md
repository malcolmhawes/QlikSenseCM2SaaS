# From Client-Managed to SaaS: **Value Added Products**

## Introduction
This guide is designed to help OEM partners with a Qlik Sense Client-managed deployments that are thinking or willing to move to SaaS.

There are a number of "Add On" capabilities with Client Managed products such as alerting reporting and chat bots that we refer to as Value Added Products in the Client  Managed product set. These tools and capabilities haven't been converted directly "as is" to Qlik Cloud and this will not be a Gap Analysis between Client Managed and SaaS but rather a guide to describe these tools in Client managed then describe aspects of QLik Cloud which are available currently to achieve similar capabilities. Qlik is building new features in Qlik Cloud continuously, to provide similar and in many cases additional capabilities in these areas.

Client Managed tools that are relivant here include :

Qlik NPrinting :

- Qlik NPrinting is a reporting platform that lets you create reports using your QlikView and Qlik Sense data, and then distribute them automatically in a range of standard formats.

Qlik Alerting :

- Qlik Alerting provides enterprise alerting for your Qlik Sense deployment. It offers self-service capabilities for users to create their own alerts on the data they have access to in Qlik Sense. It also provides the capability for users, often power users, to create and manage alerts for others with managed shared and broadcast alerts.

Qlik Insight Bot :

- Qlik Insight Bot offers a fast and easy way to ask questions and discover insights using natural language. It’s available right in Qlik Sense and through popular tools such as Slack, Skype, and Microsoft Teams. With each question, it instantly surfaces relevant charts and insights, including key drivers, comparisons, predictions and more. And its self-learning AI makes the system progressively smarter.

Information note - These are on-premise tools for Qlik Sense Enterprise on Windows and/or QlikView on Windows.


The Client managed capabilities are delivered via stand-alone value add products that requires full-stack implementation. In Qlik Cloud these capabilities are integrated experiences that are supporting various customer problems - we aren't trying to directly replicate the CM functionality
