# From Client-Managed to SaaS: **Value Added Products**

## Introduction
This guide is designed to help OEM partners with a Qlik Sense Client-managed deployments that are thinking or willing to move to SaaS.

There are a number of "Add On" capabilities with Client Managed products such as alerting reporting and chat bots that we refer to as Value Added Products in the Client  Managed product set. These tools and capabilities haven't been converted directly "as is" to Qlik Cloud and this will not be a Gap Analysis between Client Managed and SaaS but rather a guide to describe these tools in Client managed then describe aspects of QLik Cloud which are available currently to achieve similar capabilities. Qlik is building new features in Qlik Cloud continuously, to provide similar and in many cases additional capabilities in these areas.

Client Managed tools that are relivant here include :

Authentication – `Who is the user?​`  
Authorization – `What can this user do or see in Qlik Sense?​`
